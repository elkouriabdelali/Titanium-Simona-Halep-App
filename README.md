Simona Halep App
========
"Simona Halep is a Romanian professional tennis player who is currently ranked world No. 3." (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simona_Halep">Wikipedia article</a>)

Why
------------
Weekend project to refine my work with Alloy which is the new MVC framework from Titanium. And I figured what a better app to make than to one of the best tennis players! 

Next Steps
------------
- The API is from my static website, so the first step would be to bring dynamic content to the app.
- Make some design changes. That purple is nice at first, but a bit too much.

Demo
------------
You can download it and take the app for a spin to see how responsive and snappy Alloy is on both Android and iOS or you can just look at these pretty screenshots.
